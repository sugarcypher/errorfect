# Errorfect Project Vision

## Core Concept

**Errorfect** is a neurocognitive epistemology method that helps people break free from weaponized language by:

1. **Exposing hidden structures** in words like "normal," "perfect," "crazy," "success," "deserve"
2. **Revealing etymology** to show how meanings shifted over time
3. **Deconstructing word-spells** through art, wordplay, and analysis
4. **Rewriting internal vocabulary** to create more agency and self-compassion

## The Art Piece Origin

The name comes from an art installation where:
- Words "NORMAL" and "PERFECT" were spelled out in the sky
- Their first letters (N and P) were removed and placed on the ground
- The letters were shot with flaming arrows
- This revealed: **normal → or/mal** (either bad) and **perfect → error-fect** (error effect)

## Key Words to Deconstruct

1. **Normal** → or/mal (either bad) - from Latin *norma* (carpenter's square)
2. **Perfect** → error-fect - from Latin *perfectus* (thoroughly made, not flawless)
3. **Control** → counter-roll (verification, not domination)
4. **Error** → wandering (from Latin *errare*)
5. **Sin** → missing the mark (from Greek *hamartia*)
6. **Crazy** → cracked (structural damage, not soul pathology)
7. **Natural** → what arises by birth (not "morally good")
8. **Healthy** → whole (not thin/productive/compliant)
9. **Deserve** → serve well (ledger of service to something)
10. **Success** → what follows (outcome, not moral verdict)
