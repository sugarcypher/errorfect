    <section class="hero-pitch">
        <h3>Headline</h3>
        <h2 class="pitch-headline">Errorfect: Therapy for Weaponized Words</h2>

        <h3>Subheadline</h3>
        <p class="pitch-subheadline">Your nervous system runs on language.<br>We rip the first letter off the words that hurt you and make them tell the truth.</p>

        <h3>Short intro</h3>
        <p>Every day you call yourself abnormal, broken, a failure, not normal, not enough. Those aren't just words; they're tiny spells.</p>

        <p>Errorfect is a language-first micro-therapy that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>takes loaded words like normal, perfect, broken, failure, doubt, scared</li>
            <li>decapitates them (N → OR/MAL, PERFECT → ERROR-FECT, BROKEN → OAKEN, FAILURE → A LURE, SCARED → CARED, DOUBT → OUT)</li>
            <li>shows you the hidden rules they've been enforcing in your body</li>
            <li>and installs new meanings that keep reality and remove inherited self-hate.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is <strong>CLET—Cognitive Lingual / Etymological Therapy:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Not "just think positive," but debug the actual words your thoughts are built from.</em></p>

        <h3>What you'll learn to do here</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unstick identity</strong><br>Turn "I'm broken / abnormal / a failure" into "I'm oaken, in-range, being normal for my system, and this failure is a lure."</li>
            <li><strong>Expose hidden rulers</strong><br>See how normal = OR / MAL, correct = OR RECT, control = EN-TROLL, and stop obeying rulers you never agreed to.</li>
            <li><strong>Use feelings as care signals</strong><br>"I'm scared" → "I'm cared; my system is trying to protect me."</li>
            <li><strong>Rewire success language</strong><br>"I won" → "Did I just become one/alone?" "To win" → "Do I want to be in line for isolation or in where I fit?"</li>
            <li><strong>Clean up "truth"</strong><br>Notice when you're using truth with ruth (compassion) or just delivering ruthless uth that leaves only rue behind.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who this is for</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Neurodivergent, sensitive, "too much," "too intense," "too strange" people</li>
            <li>Anyone tired of being crushed by words like normal, perfect, failure, crazy</li>
            <li>Practitioners, artists, and thinkers who feel that CBT isn't wrong, just incomplete—the dictionary it works with is rigged</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core promise</h3>
        <p><strong>You don't need sweeter affirmations.<br>You need a new lexicon.</strong></p>
        <p>Errorfect gives you a toolkit to break the words that have been breaking you, and to build a language your nervous system can finally live inside.</p>
